With the advent of big data and Machine Learning along with Natural Language Processing, it has become the need of an hour to extract a certain topic or a collection of topics that the document is about. Think when you have to analyze or go through thousands of documents and categorize under 10 â€“ 15 buckets. How tedious and boring will it be ?  Thanks to Topic Modeling where instead of manually going through numerous documents, with the help of Natural Language Processing and Text Mining, each document can be categorized under a certain topic.  Thus, we expect that logically related words will co-exist in the same document more frequently than words from different topics. For example, in a document about space, it is more possible to find words such as: planet, satellite, universe, galaxy, and asteroid. Whereas, in a document about the wildlife, it is more likely to find words such as: ecosystem, species, animal, and plant, landscape. A topic contains a cluster of words that frequently occurs together. A topic modeling can connect words with similar meanings and distinguish between uses of words with multiple meanings.  A sentence or a document is made up of numerous topics and each topic is made up of numerous words.
